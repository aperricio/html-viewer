This is an HTML Viewer, and only do that.

## Why?
Because there are people who likes to use HTML and CSS over to MS Office or LibreOffice. This viewer allows them to see their documents in an app ligher than a full browser.

It needs some modules, like pyqt5 and his engine widget. Install them with pip or the package manager of your distro.
